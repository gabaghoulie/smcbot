# sausagemcbot
chatbot for sausagemcburn's stream on twitch

TODO
====
  - cron job that detects when Sausage is live and starts bot
    - python script?
    - can just go out to the twitch API 
    - how to keep track of bot PID (to determine if it's running)
      - write PID to a file? search for PID using ps -aux?
  - start commercial
  - custom sound alerts + corresponding alert browser source
